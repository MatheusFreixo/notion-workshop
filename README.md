# Notion Workshop

  Welcome to this workshop about Notion!
  It will help you to organize yourself with the Epitech Projects.
  So, first you need to create your account in [Notion](https://notion.so)

## Getting Started

  There is two ways to personalize your Notion: pre-built pages or creating your own page by yourself(the last one is nicer)
  Let's do it...

<details>
  <summary>Pre-built page</summary>

  If you don't want to take so many time creating your own, click in Templates in the sidebar, choose one of the many templates and then click "Get Template".
  You will need to do some adjustment and add new things to have a good organization.
  The next point may help you to complete your page.

<details>
  <summary>Creating your own page</summary>

  Click in "Add a page" in the sidebar and give it the name you want.
  Above I will give you some examples of what you can add in your page.

## Create a Calendar

```
/calendar view
```

## Create a Timeline
  A timeline can help you to be always organize with your projects, where you can see which project you have currently, which project will start or end.

```
/timeline view
```

## Create a Gallery view
  Creating pages for each unit will help you to organize better for each one of them.
```
/gallery view
```

## Create a Table view

  A table view can help you to organize yourself with a lot of things.
```
/table view
```
  For projects: just put there what you need to do in your project and you can have a base about what you have to do (like a to-do list). Example:
![project](https://github.com/MatheusFreixo/notion-workshop/blob/main/images/project%20to-do%20list.png)
  For roadblock: list all the modules of a specifically roadblock and its respective credits. Example:
![roadbloack](https://github.com/MatheusFreixo/notion-workshop/blob/main/images/roadblock.png)
  For year's credits: Add 3 properties, one to list all the modules of the year and the others to count the credits achieved and the credits to achieve. Example:
![credits](https://github.com/MatheusFreixo/notion-workshop/blob/main/images/credits.png)
  To do it better, you can add in '+' a new property named "status", where you can put which part doesn't start, is in progress or is already done.
